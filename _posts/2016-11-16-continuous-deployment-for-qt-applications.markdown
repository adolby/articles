This article shows you how to set up a continuous deployment pipeline to build and deploy Qt applications. It demonstrates this with template scripts on Travis CI and AppVeyor.

The templates are configuration files and build scripts compatible with [Travis CI][travis] for macOS and Ubuntu and [AppVeyor][appveyor] for Windows.

You can reference the build scripts that inspired this article in the [Kryvo][kryvo] ([https://github.com/adolby/Kryvo][kryvo]) and [Dialogue][dialogue] ([https://github.com/adolby/Dialogue][dialogue]) repositories.

## Qt specifics

### Installing Qt on your continuous deployment platform

**Travis CI**

[Qt][qt] can be installed with package managers if you are willing to accept the Qt version available on each platform.

If you want to use a different Qt version, you'll need to find a build of Qt for your operating system.

The Ubuntu template script uses my GitHub repo that provides unofficial Qt builds ([https://github.com/adolby/qt-more-builds][qtmorebuilds]). The macOS build script acquires Qt with brew.

Other Options

1. You can build Qt (or install Qt from the official installer) on a matching OS and archive the files. You'll then need to host the archive and download and unpack it in your build script. Finally, add the binaries to your source folder and add the binary path to your PATH variable.

2. Ben Lau details how to run the Qt Project installers on Linux with the [Qt-CI project][qtci]. It looks like a great alternative solution.

**AppVeyor**

AppVeyor has current versions of Qt installed on their build images, so you'll just need to add the Qt binary path to your PATH variable.

### Qt dependencies

Qt provides tools that copy dependency files for deployment on macOS and Windows.

The Qt documentation on deployment is a great resource to use when you're setting the command line parameters up for macdeployqt and windeployqt. The parameters are similar between the tools, but note that the syntax is slightly different.

There is a third-party [linuxdeployqt][linuxdeployqt] but I haven't tried it yet.

### QML apps

The deployment tools can also determine QML dependencies from your QML source files if you pass the directory containing the QML files in your project as a parameter.

To deploy a QML app on Linux, you'll need to note your dependencies yourself or compare the output from macdeployqt or windeployqt.

The Dialogue repo shows how to copy the necessary files for deploying a QML project on Linux.

There is also a third-party [linuxdeployqt][linuxdeployqt] but I haven't tried it yet.

### Linux packages

Travis CI runs Ubuntu 12.04 or Ubuntu 14.04; the latter is available by specifying dist: trusty in your .travis.yml configuration file. If you are developing your application on a different version of Ubuntu or another operating system, some software packages may not be available in the same version you developed your application with.

To fix this, you can create your own package repositories or build your application's missing dependencies from source.

## Templates

Below are example build config files for Travis CI and AppVeyor and build scripts.

The config file demonstrates deployment to [GitHub Releases][releases]. There are other deployment targets available on Travis CI and AppVeyor.

The templates use the Git tag name as a version number, which allows you to differentiate between deployed builds with [semantic versioning][semantic] (or whatever versioning scheme you prefer).

## Travis CI

The Travis CI config file specifies building and deployment on macOS and Ubuntu 14.04.

To get started on Travis CI you'll need to create a GitHub (or other Git hosting provider) repository and then enable it on Travis CI.

To allow Travis to deploy to GitHub Releases, you'll need to [create a personal access token on GitHub][githubtoken]. Next, you'll use the Travis tool to encrypt (hash) it as a secure environment variable. Then copy the output over the secure key in the deployment section with your encrypted (hashed) personal access key.

This process is detailed under the [Environment Variable section in the Travis CI documentation][encrypttravis].

Alternatively, you could add the unencrypted personal access token as an environment variable through the Travis CI settings page for your repository.

Travis CI is configured to build on all branches and will only deploy on tagged commits.

## macOS

This macOS script builds and run tests for CI, then packages the application as a dmg file archive for deployment. $TAG_NAME is a Travis CI-specific environment variable containing the tag name of the current build.

**build_macOS.sh**

```shell
#!/bin/bash

set -o errexit -o nounset

# Hold on to current directory
project_dir=$(pwd)

# Output macOS version

# Update platform
echo "Updating platform..."

# You can use the appdmg command line app to create your dmg file if
# you want to use a custom background and icon arrangement. I'm still
# working on this for my apps, myself. If you want to do this, you'll
# remove the -dmg option above.

## Ubuntu 14.04

This Ubuntu script builds and run tests for CI, then packages the application as a portable archive and creates an installer executable for deployment. $TAG_NAME is a Travis CI-specific environment variable containing the tag name of the current build.

## AppVeyor

The AppVeyor config file specifies building and deployment on Windows.

To get started on AppVeyor you'll need to create a GitHub (or other Git hosting provider) repository and then enable it on AppVeyor.

To allow Travis to deploy to GitHub Releases, you'll need to [create a personal access token on GitHub][githubtoken]. Next, you'll use the Encrypt data tool, which can be found on the accounts dropdown menu after signing in on AppVeyor, to encrypt (hash) it as a secure environment variable. Then copy the output over the secure key in the deployment section with your encrypted (hashed) personal access key.

This process is detailed under the [Environment variables section in the AppVeyor documentation][encryptappveyor].

Alternatively, you could add the unencrypted personal access token as an environment variable through the AppVeyor settings page for your repository.

AppVeyor is configured to build on all branches and will only deploy on tagged commits.

You can build with the Visual C++ compiler from multiple Visual Studio versions or with MinGW. If you're building with the Visual C++ compiler, you'll need to call vcvarsall.bat with %PLATFORM% as the argument, where %PLATFORM% is an AppVeyor environment variable.

**appveyor.yml**
